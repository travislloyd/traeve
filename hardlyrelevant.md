    hello friend and user of the WWW,
  </p>
  <p>
    if an album drops on the internet and like three people download it ... did it make a sound?
  </p>
  <p>
    if you spend your time alone with a screen, following links, literally whichever way, to a divine moment .... then what?
  </p>
  <p>
    an impression is just that; lots of time tomorrow to move on.
  </p>
  <p>
    enter <em>"Hardly Relevant"</em>: a medium for meaning in the digital age.  please join me in a year-long exercise in long-distance friendship, musical discovery, and shared experience.

    starting january 1st I’ll be making a weekly "mixtape" to document and share my musical life.  the tapes might include anything: songs by others, my own demos, field recordings, poems, etc, etc.  they'll be equal parts musical diary, release medium, and handwritten letter.  this project is a little attempt to create a personal musical experience in our depersonalized digital culture. music is a social phenomenon, so stop streaming that algorithmically chill playlist, whip out the tapedeck, and pop in my deranged mix.
  </p>

    the tapes will be handmade for a different person each week.  this recipient will be on my mind while i’m putting together the mix, but i don’t plan to curate based on their tastes.  instead the tapes will reflect what i'm excited about at a given point in time.  i'll post digital versions online, but there'll be just one copy of the physical tape.  if you’d like to receive one, all i ask in return is that once it arrives you send me <strong>(1) a photo of "you and the tape," loosely interpreted</strong>, and <strong>(2) some "handmade" item of your choosing.</strong>  this could be another mixtape, a photograph, a letter, a drawing, a poem...up to you.  i just ask that you put some intentional energy into making it a personal object.  the idea that this energy can create relevance and ward off obscurity is the focus of this project.  let's see what we can do.

  <p>
    fondly yours,
