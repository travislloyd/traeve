Personal website for Travis Lloyd.  This site is built using the Jekyll framework to be hosted on Github pages.  It also contains a utility script, publish.rb, that will handle publishing Hardly Relevant mixes.

## Usage

Run `bin/publish <PATH_TO_MANIFEST>` to publish a Hardly Relevant mix described by a manifest file. The manifests are located in /manifests and /manifests/manifestSchema.json is the schema definition.

## Testing

Run `rspec` from the base directory to run the test suite.
