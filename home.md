## technology work

i've always been interested in the democratizing potential of the internet.  in the past i’ve worked on projects that helped unknown artists make and distribute their creative work, but these days i’m more interested in technology that addresses the social issues facing urban populations, such as issues of economic and racial inequality.

i currently work at [whole whale](https://www.wholewhale.com/){:target="_blank"}, a brooklyn-based social-impact-focused digital agency.

#### past projects:

* [amazon storywriter](https://storywriter.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}: _cloud-based text editor for screenplays_
* [amazon studios](https://studios.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}: _screenplay submission platform_
* [amazon video direct](https://videodirect.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}: _video self-publishing platform_

## art
i'm interested in how digital technologies can enrich, not replace, physical communities and lives lived away from screens.

#### current project:
[hardly relevant](hardlyrelevant.html): _a medium for meaning in the digital age_
